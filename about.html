<h1>About The Sync Hole</h1>
<p>The Sync hole is a set of pages to help demo synchronisation requirements for WebDriver.</p>
<p>The source for these pages is on Github.</p>
<p>There are no server side processes used. Anything that looks like a server side process
is probably just a simulation, loading in a JSON file, or just a delay on the front end.
This was to allow the pages to be hosted on any static site delivery platform.</p>
